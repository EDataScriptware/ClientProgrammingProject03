- So, I added a dll folder that consists of RESTaccess api for the project. Organization was kept in mind while doing this while thinking about Enterprise in mindset.

- RIT's unique color Web Color converted to RGB (243, 110, 33) is used here.
- LinkActive color is set to match this
-- in order to avoid mono-color : gray backgrounds are used to overlap.

- Music functionality included

- Organization in code by #region [text]
-- Divided by sections calling methods as mentioned in comments

- Professor Floeser said to "Take undesirable bugs and treat it as a feature" and so I shall

- Caught an API mistake in /degrees/graduate/ with available certificates. 
-- Networking should be its own certificate

- Sorted Minors courses

- Picture Box in People have been resized to stretch because Matt H. has a very big picture and some people have very small picture.
-- Everyone gets the same size in 200x200 to maintain consistency. [ no one is special :( ]

- A tab within a tab in Resources and Research to minimalize, generalize, and simplify the flow of information

- ContactUs webpage ON the WindowsForm 
-- Map webpage is not possible without plugins - google map does not like window forms and vice versa 

- A new window forms "Breaking News!" is used instead of News tab.
-- breaking news's number is randomized after each time the button is pressed to make "sense" in reality
-- It doesn't make sense for me in "Client's" mindset to use a News tab.
--- A new forms is made - was not taught in class but had to research

- We haven't been taught the part for Courses. It was a big pain to do it. You have to read the error message carefully and try to solve the error message.
